      <h2>Jewelry Box</h2>
       <img src="img/jewelrybox.jpg" alt="Jewelry Box" title="Zitan Wood Jewelry Box with Traditional Joinery" class="gallery-img" />

      <p>This exquisite jewelry box is handcrafted from Indian small-leaf Zitan (red sandalwood), a timber long revered as the "Wood of Emperors." Its remarkably dense grain, shifting hues from rich red-brown to deep violet-black, and silky, intricate texture make it a material unlike any other.</p>

      <p>Zitan grows with an almost meditative slowness — a single growth ring every five years, requiring over 800 years to mature. It is the hardest of all woods, and its rarity only adds to its legendary status.</p>

      <p>What sets this piece apart is its joinery craftsmanship. Built entirely with traditional Chinese mortise-and-tenon joints, it contains no nails, no screws — only timeless precision. This ancient technique is the soul of classical Chinese furniture, allowing the box to endure for generations while preserving a sense of elegance and spiritual integrity.</p>

      <p>This jewelry box is not just a container — it is a treasure in itself, holding not only your adornments but also centuries of artistry and heritage.</p>
